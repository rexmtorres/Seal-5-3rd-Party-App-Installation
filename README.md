## Preface

Apart from installing apps through the BYD app marketplace, which offers an **extemely** limited (for now) set of apps, there are 2 unofficial ways of installing 3rd-party apps, which I will show you in this tutorial.  The 2 methods that will be shown here are, generally speaking, safe to follow.  However, as they are ***unofficial*** methods, they might affect your warranty.  So, follow at your own risk.  I take no responsibility, whatsoever, for any loss or damage incurred as a result of using and relying on the information on this tutorial.

Please also note that, depending on your infotainment system version, the steps mentioned here, to install apps, may or may not work.

## Method 1: Sideloading

1. Prepare a USB flashdrive by formatting it to **FAT32** on a (Windows/Mac/Linux) computer.  Note that, especially when using Windows' built-in formatter, the FAT32 option may not appear if your flashdrive's capacity is greater than 32GB.  So you may want to use a smaller capacity flashdrive.

2. In your FAT32-formatted flashdrive, create a folder named "Third Party Apps 63" (without the quotes).
   
   *Note: This is specifically for the Philippine market.  If you're outside the Philippnes, replace "63" with your respective [country code](https://countrycode.org/philippines).*

3. Copy your downloaded APKs into the "Third Party Apps 63" folder.
   
   *Note: Be sure that you trust the source of your APKs.  One of the more popular sources of APKs is [APKPure](https://apkpure.com/).  Also note that APKPure provides 2 formats of an application package: APK and APKX.  Be sure to choose APK.  APKX is APKPure's own extension of the APK format and you will need an additional application manager to install it.*

4. Eject your flashdrive from your computer.

5. With your BYD Seal 5 off, plug your flashdrive into the USB data port (lower USB port) located underneath the center console.

6. Start your car and wait for the infotainment to initialize.

7. Once the system has initialized, you will be prompted to enter a password.  Enter "BYD6125F" (without quotes) and press OK.

8. You will then be able to see the list of the APKs you copied.  Tick the checkbox on the APKs you want to install and press Install. The "Success" counter at the bottom-right corner will indicate the number of apps successfully installed, while the "Failed" counter will indicate those that didn't install.  Failed installation can either mean that the APK you downloaded is corrupted, or that the BYD system does not support them.

9. After installing them, you can press Back or Home on the navigation bar and you should see the icon/s of the app/s you installed.

## Method 2: Unlocked Package Manager
